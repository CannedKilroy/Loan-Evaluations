    "For the next model, a decision tree will be used. This gives a good variety as log reg is probability based, svm distance based. It also handles non linearity well compared to linear SVM, log reg, and is a much quicker algorithm for large datasets compared to svm's. Since the last few model accuracies stagnated, there might be some non linearity in the data they are not capturing well. Therefore a decsison tree is a good next model, however they can be prone to overfitting.  \n",
