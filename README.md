The goal of this project is to use Machine Learning (ML) to maximize loans given to credit worthy applicants and minimize loans issued to borrowers likely to default. By using historical loan data the model can identify patterns and best metrics that correlate to loan repayment. Training a model on features such as income, credit score, employment history and more, it would be possible to automate the process and increase the number of loans made as well as mitigate credit risk.
