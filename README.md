# Classification - Loan Data Analysis

### Project Overview
-- ----
With an estimated size of $153 billion dollars in 2022, the peer to peer (P2P) loan market is a viable alternative to traditional lending institutions for individuals seeking small loans. However, investors face challenges in assessing the creditworthiness of applicants due to the uncertainty of repayment, the lack of collateralization, and the minimum borrower information in the P2P markets.

The Primary objective of this project is to **predict whether a borrower will defualt on their loan, based on the charecteristics of the loan and the borrowers financial standing**, allowing investors to better minimize credit risk.

The secondary objective is to explore ***whether a similar accuracy is achievable without the use of grey metrics such as fico scores.***

Both classical statistical methods such as Logistic Regression, and more complex machine learning models will be used. 
Including:
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- XGBoost
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


### Dataset Description
-- ----
* The LendingClub dataset covers P2P loans made on the Lendingclub marketplace from 2007 to 2018. It covers both information on the loan, including loan amount and status, as well as applicant information. The data is approximatly 2 million rows, with 151 columns, containing text and numeric data.  The full data dictionary can be found here:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download and extract the csv's from:  
[LendingClub Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club)
4. Place `accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv` inside /Data/Lending_club/
5. Download and extract the csv's from:  
[LendingClub Data Dictionary](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonchan2003/lending-club-data-dictionary)
6. Place `Lending Club Data Dictionary Approved.csv` inside /Data/Lending_club/

Then run the notebooks in order:

### Results
---
Accuracy, precision, and recall metrics will be used to evaluate a models performance. 
- ***Logistic Regression***: Logistic regression will serve as a good baseline due to its explainability and simplicity

### Next Steps
---
- Standardize employee title using regex or NLP
- Standardize loan description given by the borrower using regex or NLP
- Re-Introduce the geographical features by using 3rd party information such as average or median income for a specified state or zip code
-
